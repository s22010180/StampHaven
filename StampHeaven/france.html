            <h2  id="fh1">History Of France Stamps</h2> <br>
            <p>
                France is one of the world's oldest and most respected stamp-issuing countries,
                 with a long history of producing beautiful and innovative stamps. Here is a brief history of French stamps. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                France issued its first postage stamp, the "Ceres" stamp, in 1849. 
                It featured a portrait of the Roman goddess of agriculture, Ceres, and was available in three denominations.
                 Since then, France has issued many beautiful and notable stamps,
                 featuring everything from famous people and events to art and architecture. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                After the introduction of the Ceres stamp in 1849, France continued to produce a wide variety of stamps in different denominations,
                 colors, and designs. One notable example is the Bordeaux issue, a series of stamps issued in 1870-1871 during the Franco-Prussian War.
                 These stamps were printed in two colors (red and blue) and featured the profiles of Napoleon III and Ceres.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                 In the early 1900s, France began to issue stamps featuring the allegorical figure of Marianne, 
                 who symbolizes the French Republic. The first Marianne stamp was issued in 1900 and depicted her wearing a Phrygian cap,
                 which is a symbol of liberty. Since then, Marianne has been featured on numerous French stamps in different styles and designs,
                 often accompanied by other national symbols such as the French flag, rooster, or heraldic devices.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                During World War I, France issued several stamps to raise funds for war efforts and charities,
                 such as the Red Cross and war orphans. One notable stamp is the Orphelins stamp,
                 issued in 1918, which features a young girl holding a flower and the words "War Orphans" in French.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                After World War II, France began to issue stamps in partnership with the United Nations and other international organizations,
                 such as UNESCO and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
                These stamps often feature cultural landmarks, scientific achievements, or global themes.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                In recent years, France has continued to produce beautiful and innovative stamps, often featuring art,
                 architecture, nature, or popular culture. The French postal service, La Poste, also issues special stamps for various occasions and events,
                 such as the Tour de France bicycle race, the Cannes Film Festival, or the Paris Air Show.
